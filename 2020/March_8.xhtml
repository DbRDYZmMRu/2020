    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         An excerpt from the consolation of philosophy, penned down by Arthur Schopenhauer:</p>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl"><em>We should always be mindful of the fact that no man is ever very far from the state in which he would readily want to seize a sword or poison in order to bring his existence to an end; and those who are far from believing this could easily be convinced of the opposite by an accident, an illness, a violent change of fortune – or of the weather.</em></p>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl">Meaning those who aren’t convinced of the nature of misery in existence need only have a turn of circumstance from good to bad.</p>

    <div class="top1"></div>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         The moment you know it takes reading the sequel to the first in a series of a quadlogy to fully understand, grasp, hence enjoying the story<em>, </em>it gives you a sense of repose, reminds you of the inherent sense of perseverance. What I mean is naturally you find it difficult to keep at a task longer than . . . who knows? anyway I know you get. Love out.</p>

    <div class="top1"></div>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         Another excerpt; from today’s reading of Mind of My Mind: <em>“You read impressions from the things you touch,” she had said to Jan. “But I think you put impressions into things, too.”</em></p>
