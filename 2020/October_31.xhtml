    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         Here is a musing from days back:</p>

    <div class="top1"></div>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         <em>The gibes I have to deal with all day from the prestidigitators, their obsequious lethargic ugly strident cries of malevolent despair, most times camouflaged with a pretence of superiority, in difference; the poisoning of the blood stream. In mask switching; the hail of being similar besides the difference. The dreaming; being the articulation of my thoughts, as they appear, brightest when adorned as they could be with actions. How adorned are your thoughts?</em></p>

    <div class="top1"></div>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         <em>I meet up with myself in these writings, when questions are asked. My inner dialogue like a lake frozen, still waiting for the thaw season. The thaw season like every season, ephemeral, changing, as thoughts beg to be adorned in different ways. In action, in writing, in contemplation ... The thaw season the allegorical element to be left for contemplation. A cycle I think.</em></p>

    <div class="top1"></div>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         <em>If all these didn't happen, maybe that pinball ball would have destroyed me, a daemon process insisting to remain online, unsure of its validity, not out of a lack of resource; an incapability to keep running, an unwillingness to be the tributary.</em></p>

    <div class="top1"></div>

    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         <em>Like having a point of view and choosing not to have a point of view, my current dialectical opinion being of the opinion that one understanding of a system isn't good enough for understanding all systems. Put simply. </em></p>
